# Standard Relayer

![Standard Relayer](../../.gitbook/assets/auto-relayer.png)

The Standard Relayer provides a mechanism for a contract on one chain to send a message to a contract on a different chain without the developer dealing with any off chain deployments.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently the Standard Relayer feature is limited to EVM environments.

## On Chain

On chain, a smart contract interacts with the [IWormholeRelayer](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-relayer-solidity-sdk/blob/main/src/interfaces/IWormholeRelayer.sol) to send and receive messages.

### Sending a message

To send a message to a contract on another EVM chain, we can call the `sendPayloadToEvm` method, provided by the `IWormholeRelayer` interface.

```solidity
function sendPayloadToEvm(
    // Chain ID in Wormhole format
    uint16 targetChain,     
    // Contract Address on target chain we're sending a message to
    address targetAddress,  
    // The payload, encoded as bytes
    bytes memory payload,   
    // How much value to attach to the delivery transaction 
    uint256 receiverValue,  
    // The gas limit to set on the delivery transaction
    uint256 gasLimit        
) external payable returns (
    // Unique, incrementing ID, used to identify a message
    uint64 sequence
);
```

The `sendPayloadToEvm` method is marked `payable` so we can pay for our transaction to be submitted.

The value to attach to the invocation is determined by calling the `quoteEVMDeliveryPrice`, which provides an estimate of the cost of gas on the target chain.

```solidity
function quoteEVMDeliveryPrice(
    // Chain ID in Wormhole format
    uint16 targetChain,
    // How much value to attach to delivery transaction 
    uint256 receiverValue,
    // The gas limit to attach to the delivery transaction
    uint256 gasLimit
) external view returns (
    // How much value to attach to the send call
    uint256 nativePriceQuote, 
    // 
    uint256 targetChainRefundPerGasUnused
);
```

This method should be called prior to sending a message and the value returned for `nativePriceQuote` should be attached to the call to send the payload in order to cover the cost of the transaction on the target chain.

In total, sending a message across EVM chains can be as simple as:

```solidity
// Get a quote for the cost of gas for delivery
(cost, ) = wormholeRelayer.quoteEVMDeliveryPrice(
    targetChain,
    valueToSend,
    GAS_LIMIT
);

// Send the message
wormholeRelayer.sendPayloadToEvm{value: cost}(
    targetChain,
    targetAddress,
    abi.encode(payload),
    valueToSend, 
    GAS_LIMIT
);
```

### Receiving a message

To receive a message using the `Standard Relayer` feature, the target contract must implement the [IWormholeReceiver](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-relayer-solidity-sdk/blob/main/src/interfaces/IWormholeReceiver.sol) interface.

```solidity
function receiveWormholeMessages(
    bytes memory payload,           // Message passed by source contract 
    bytes[] memory additionalVaas,  // Any additional VAAs that are needed (Note: these are unverified) 
    bytes32 sourceAddress,          // The address of the source contract
    uint16 sourceChain,             // The Wormhole chain ID
    bytes32 deliveryHash            // A hash of contents, useful for replay protection
) external payable;
```

The logic inside the function body may be whatever business logic is required to take action on the specific payload.

### Other Considerations

Some implementation details should be considered during development to ensure safety and improve UX.

* Receiving a message from relayer
  * Check for expected emitter
  * call parseAndVerify on any additionalVAAs
* Replay protection
* Message Ordering
  * no guarantees on order of messages delivered
* Fowarding/Call Chaining
* Refunding overpayment of gasLimit
* Refunding overpayment of value sent

## Off Chain

If taking advantage of Automatic Relaying, no off chain logic need be implemented.

While no off chain programs are required, a developer may want to track the progress of messages in flight. To track the progress of messages in flight, use the worm CLI tool's `status` subcommand.

```sh
$ worm status mainnet ethereum 0xdeadbeef
```

See the [CLI tool docs](../../reference/cli-docs.md) for installation and usage.
