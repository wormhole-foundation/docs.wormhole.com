# Token Transfer with Relayer Fee (Polygon to Oasis)

In this example we’ll fetch the fee schedule and attach a relayer fee onto our transaction. This is a non trivial example as we’ll also use Polygon as a source chain, which has some quirks when it comes to gas estimation. In the future, this whole process is being simplified, so check back in the future for hopefully much simpler version of this example.

For this example, we’ll need a couple of packages:

```
npm i --save @certusone/wormhole-sdk ethers node-fetch
```

Then in our source file:

```typescript
import { BigNumber, ethers } from "ethers";
import fetch from "node-fetch";
import {
    getEmitterAddressEth,
    hexToUint8Array,p
    nativeToHexString,
    parseSequenceFromLogEth,
    CHAIN_ID_POLYGON,
    CHAIN_ID_OASIS,
    transferFromEthNative,
    getIsTransferCompletedEth,
		setDefaultWasm
} from "@certusone/wormhole-sdk";
```

#### Setup the Polygon and Oasis Wallets

First, let us set up the two wallets we’ll be sending and receiving from. While we are instantiating both wallets with their private keys, we only need the Public key of the receiving wallet for this example.

```typescript
const EmeraldWallet = new ethers.Wallet(
    privatekey_emerald,
    new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider("https://emerald.oasis.dev")
);
const PolygonWallet = new ethers.Wallet(
    privatekey_polygon,
    new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider("https://polygon-rpc.com/")
);
```

#### Fetch the fee schedule

Next, we’ll fetch the fee schedule for the Portal Token Bridge relayer. This fee schedule will give us the minimum fee for each recipient chain that the relayer will accept. As long as we attach at least that fee in the relayer fee, we can be fairly confident that the relayer will pick up the transaction and relay it to the recipient chain. The fee will cover the gas cost for the relayer along with a little extra to make it worth their time to run the relayer service.

We will also define the transfer amount in this step. The fee schedule will either return a flat fee in USD for the recipient chain, or a percentage fee (usually only for Ethereum). Either way, we’ll need to calculate the fee in in BigNumber format (no decimals).

For example, 1 MATIC on Polygon is 1e18 wei, or 1000000000000000000 wei. Because EVM has a hard time with floating point math, we have to do all our transactions in this small unit, to avoid decimal numbers.

```typescript
const transferAmount = BigNumber.from("1000000000000000000"); // We are sending 1 MATIC over the wall to Oasis
const relayerFeeSchedule = await (await fetch(
	"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/certusone/wormhole-relayer-list/main/relayer.json"
)).json();
```

The fee schedule has the following interface:

```typescript
export interface RelayerFeeSchedule {
    supportedTokens: ChainAddress[];
    relayers: Relayer[];
    feeSchedule: FeeSchedule;
}

interface ChainAddress {
    chainId: number;
    address: string;
    coingeckoId: string;
}

interface Relayer {
    name: string;
    url: string;
}

interface FeeSchedule {
    [chainId: string]: {
        type: "flat" | "percent";
        feeUsd?: number;
        feePercent?: number;
        gasEstimate?: number;
    };
}
```

After we’ve fetched the fee schedule, we need to find the fee in Wei that needs to be paid to the Relayer. At the time of writing, Oasis has a flat fee of $0.50, so to calculate how much MATIC we need to pay for the $0.50 fee, we need to fetch the MATIC price. Let’s use the free CoinGecko api:

```typescript
let feeWei: number;
if (relayerFeeSchedule.feeSchedule[CHAIN_ID_OASIS].type == "flat") {
    const feeUsd = relayerFeeSchedule.feeSchedule[CHAIN_ID_OASIS].feeUsd
    const MATIC_PRICE = (
        await (
            await fetch(
                "https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/token_price/polygon-pos?contract_addresses=0x0d500b1d8e8ef31e21c99d1db9a6444d3adf1270&vs_currencies=usd"
            )
        ).json()
    )["0x0d500b1d8e8ef31e21c99d1db9a6444d3adf1270"]["usd"];

    feeWei = (feeUsd / MATIC_PRICE) * 1e18;
} else if (relayerFeeSchedule.feeSchedule[CHAIN_ID_OASIS].type == "percent") {
    let feeWei = (relayerFeeSchedule.feeSchedule[CHAIN_ID_OASIS].feePercent /100) * transferAmount.toNumber();
}
```

#### Add override for gas estimation for Polygon

Because the source chain is Polygon, we need to do this additional step to overestimate the gas. This is because ethers library has some problems with fee estimation after EIP-1559.

```typescript
let overrides;
let feeData = await PolygonWallet.provider.getFeeData();
overrides = {
    maxFeePerGas: feeData.maxFeePerGas?.mul(50) || undefined,
    maxPriorityFeePerGas:
        feeData.maxPriorityFeePerGas?.mul(50) || undefined,
};
```

#### Emit Portal Message

Now we have all the pieces we need to emit a Portal Bridge message with a relay fee attached. We do this using the transferFromEthNative() method. EthNative is used because we’re transferring the native token of the Polygon network rather than an ERC20 token.

```typescript
const POLYGON_TOKEN_BRIDGE = "0x5a58505a96D1dbf8dF91cB21B54419FC36e93fdE";

const receipt = await transferFromEthNative(
    POLYGON_TOKEN_BRIDGE,
    PolygonWallet,
    transferAmount,
    CHAIN_ID_OASIS,
    hexToUint8Array(
        nativeToHexString(
            await EmeraldWallet.getAddress(),
            CHAIN_ID_OASIS
        ) || ""
    ),
    BigNumber.from(feeWei.toString()),
    overrides
);
console.log("Receipt: ", receipt);

const POLYGON_CORE_BRIDGE_ADDRESS =
    "0x7A4B5a56256163F07b2C80A7cA55aBE66c4ec4d7";
const sequence = parseSequenceFromLogEth(
    receipt,
    POLYGON_CORE_BRIDGE_ADDRESS
);
const emitterAddress = getEmitterAddressEth(POLYGON_TOKEN_BRIDGE);
console.log("Sequence: ", sequence);
console.log("EmitterAddress: ", emitterAddress);
```

Let’s walk through each of the arguments of this function and what they mean.

POLYGON\_TOKEN\_BRIDGE is the address of the Portal Token Bridge on the Polygon network. You can find it, amongst other addresses on the Deployment Info page.

PolygonWallet is a signer you get from the Ethers library that holds a private key that can sign transactions,

transferAmount is a BigNumber that contains the amount to transfer in the smallest unit of the network.

CHAIN\_ID\_OASIS is a constant that identifies the target chain

hexToUint8Array() translates the target publickey into a wormhole public key.

BigNumber.from(feeWei.toString()) identifies the fee in smallest unit of the network for the relayer.

overrides are used if we need to override the gas cost, which we need to do for Polygon.

#### Check VAA was Signed

Wait 15 min for finality on Polygon and check to see if was submitted. If successful you’ll be able to fetch a base64 encoded vaaBytes. We need this in the next step where we check if the transaction was successfully relayed.

```tsx
await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 900000)); //15m in seconds
const WORMHOLE_RPC = "https://wormhole-v2-mainnet-api.certus.one";
let vaaBytes = undefined;
while (!vaaBytes) {
    try {
        vaaBytes = (
            await (
                await fetch(
                    `${WORMHOLE_RPC}/v1/signed_vaa/${CHAIN_ID_POLYGON}/${emitterAddress}/${sequence}`
                )
            ).json()
        ).vaaBytes;
    } catch (e) {
        await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 5000));
    }
}
console.log("VAA Bytes: ", vaaBytes);
```

#### Check if Transfer Was Completed

In the final step we use the getIsTransferCompletedEth() method to check if the transfer was completed on the Oasis Emerald chain. If it’s not, we wait 5 seconds and check again.

```rust
setDefaultWasm("node"); //only needed if running in node.js
const EMERALD_TOKEN_BRIDGE = "0x5848C791e09901b40A9Ef749f2a6735b418d7564";
let transferCompleted = await getIsTransferCompletedEth(
    EMERALD_TOKEN_BRIDGE,
    EmeraldWallet.provider,
    vaaBytes
);
while (!transferCompleted) {
    await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 5000));
    transferCompleted = await getIsTransferCompletedEth(
        EMERALD_TOKEN_BRIDGE,
        EmeraldWallet.provider,
        vaaBytes
    );
}

console.log("VAA Relayed!");
```

And that’s it! You’ve successfully programmatically relayed a transaction!
