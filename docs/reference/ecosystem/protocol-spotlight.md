Wormhole allows developers to build their own protocol that takes advantage of the ability to pass messages across sovereign Blockchains.  

# Protocol Spotlight 

**Allbridge**
Allbridge is a blockchain bridge that allows tokens and/or arbitrary data to be transferred from one chain to another. To conduct these transfers, Allbridge utilizes the Wormhole core layer to perform a cross-chain swap. It provides a one-click solution for bridging native stable coins between chains without the need to wrap and unwrap the transferred tokens. 

**Pyth**
A first-party financial oracle for crypto market. Pyth connects high-fidelity market data from the worldâ€™s largest professional traders and exchanges to any smart contract and uses wormhole for cross chain communication. 

**Dust Labs**
The [recent move of Degods and Yoots](https://wormhole.com/wormhole-takes-degods-y00ts-cross-chain/), one of the biggest Solana NFT projects to Ethereum and Polygon respectively was supported by the use of the Wormhole NFT bridge.

**Via  Protocol**
Bridge aggregator that connected to 25 networks and 21 bridges and more than $1.4 in total value moved. 
 
**UbeSwap**
Ubeswap is a protocol for decentralized exchange and automated liquidity provision on Celo using xAssets and Wormhole connect to tap into the liquidty of wormhole network. 

## Token Bridge (Portal)

Tokens are transferred from one chain to another using a lockup/mint and burn/unlock mechanism. While many bridges work on this basic premise, this implementation achieves this by relying on the *generic message passing protocol* provided by Wormhole to support routing the lock and burn events from one chain to another. A single message can be used for both token and Message transfer by attaching arbitrary string of data to the payload. 

### Transfers

In order to transfer tokens from A to B, we must lock the tokens on A and mint them on B.

It is important that the tokens on A have been proven to be locked before the minting can occur on B. To facilitate this process, chain A first locks the tokens and emits a message indicating that the locking has been completed. This message has the following structure, and is referred to as a transfer message:

```rust
u8      payload_id = 1          Transfer
u256    amount                  Amount of tokens being transferred.
u8[32]  token_address           Address on the origin chain.
u16     token_chain             Numeric ID for the origin chain.
u8[32]  to                      Address on the destination chain.
u16     to_chain                Numeric ID for the destination chain.
u256    fee                     Portion of the amount paid to a relayer.
```

This structure contains contains everything needed for the receiving chain to learn about a lockup event. Once Chain B receives this payload it can mint the corresponding asset.

Note that Chain B is agnostic as to how the tokens on the sending side were locked. They could have been burned by a mint or locked in a custody account. The protocol simply relays the event once a sufficient amount of guardians have attested its existence.

### Attestation

The Transfer event above is missing an important detail. While the program on Chain B can trust the message to inform it of token lockup events, it has no way of knowing what the token being locked up actually is. The address alone is a meaningless value to most users.

To solve this, the Token Bridge supports token attestation. Chain A emits a message containing metadata about an address, which Chain B can store in order to learn the name, symbol, and decimal precision of a token address.

The message format for this action is as so:

```rust
u8         payload_id = 2
[32]byte   token_address
u16        token_chain
u8         decimals
[32]byte   symbol
[32]byte   name
```

An important detail of the token bridge is that an attestation is in fact required before a token can be transferred. This is because without knowing a token's decimal precision, it is not possible for Chain B to correctly mint the correct amount of tokens when processing a transfer.

### Relayers

Token bridge transfers must be completed on the target chain, which will require a transaction fee to be paid in the native currency of that chain. As many users performing transfers may not have any currency, wormhole provides a mechanism to allow relayers to perform the final step and pay the fees on the user's behalf.

This mechanism works by allowing users to specify a portion of the tokens being transferred as a fee. When the transfer VAA is submitted, the contract will pay the fee portion to the relayer instead of the user.

Currently, there are no public relayers for Wormhole.


## NFT Bridge

The mechanics behind the NFT bridge are nearly identical to the token bridge. However, unlike with a transfer of normal tokens, an NFT requires the creation of only a single asset on the target chain. An amount is therefore not part of the payload which makes NFTs **Non-Fungible**. This also means an attestation is not required for an NFT transfer, as all relevant data is passed in the transfer itself.

The NFT bridge is ERC721 aware and translates the associated metadata from each chain's format to the format on the receiving side of a transfer message. Upon receipt of a transfer event, the NFT bridge will mint a token matching the target chain's NFT standard. ie ERC721 -> SPL

The NFT transfer message is similar to the Token Bridge, and looks like so:

```rust
u8       payload_id = 1         TransferPayload
u8[32]   nft_address            Address on the origin chain.
u16      nft_chain              Numeric ID for the origin chain.
u8[32]   symbol                 UTF-8 Encoded NFT Symbol
u8[32]   name                   UTF-8 Encoded NFT Name.
u8[32]   token_id               32-byte Token ID
u8       url_length             URL Length
u8[]     url                    UTF-8 Encoded URL.
u8[32]   to                     Address on the destination chain.
u16      to_chain               Numeric ID for the destination chain.
```
