## Wormhole Upgrade Approaching 

Expect Temporary Downtime: As we approach the launch of the Wormhole Gateway chain, there is a required upgrade being executed by the network of Wormhole Guardian nodes. 

This upgrade will add Gateway to the Wormhole stack, bringing connectivity to the entire Cosmos ecosystem and more security features to the broader Wormhole network.

Please take note that token bridging will be paused for several hours on Monday, August 21 around 6AM UTC during the upgrade. 

Please refer to this page for updates on the status of the upgrade.
