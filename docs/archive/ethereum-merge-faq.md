Ethereum is anticipated to update its consensus mechanism from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) on or around September 15, 2022 ([TTD 58750000000000000000000](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/08/12/finalized-no-36/)). Six years in the making, this milestone will reduce energy consumption for the Ethereum network by [a projected 99.95%](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/country-power-no-more/) compared to PoW, make it more secure and allow for easier implementations of new scaling solutions. Here is [a great video](https://youtu.be/EEuPmA8w0Kc) about the technical details of the Merge, as well as [the official explanation](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/#what-is-the-merge) by the Ethereum Foundation.

Please see the below for details on how the Ethereum Merge - and possible fork(s) - will affect Wormhole core layer and Portal bridge users.

Note: The Ethereum token will still be named ETH; on this page, we only use ETH-PoS and ETH-PoW to distinguish them from one another clearly.\

**Here are the most common questions:**

**Q:** How does the Ethereum Merge affect Wormhole/Portal users? What considerations should users make when transferring assets cross-chain?\
**A:** There are no actions required from users to upgrade to ETH-PoS.\


**Q:** Will the transactions on Wormhole and/or Portal be paused before/during/after the Merge?\
**A:** No disruptions are planned, so no transfers will be paused.\


**Q:** Do I have to do anything to get the “new” ETH-PoS?\
**A:** No. After the Merge, when unwrapping Portal-wrapped ETH to its native form, it will automatically become ETH-PoS.\


**Q:** In the case of a fork (or several forks), will Wormhole support the forked ETH-PoW?\
**A:** The 19 Wormhole Guardians have reached consensus to only support the Ethereum PoS network at this time.\


**Q:** Do users receive both wETH-PoS and wETH-PoW once the Merge hits?\
**A:** No. There won’t be two or more versions of Portal-wrapped ETH. Portal-wrapped ETH will stay Portal-wrapped ETH, which can always be unwrapped to native ETH, which after the Merge is ETH-PoS.\


**Q:** I have owned Portal-wrapped ETH since before the Merge. Do I get the “old” ETH when I unwrap it now?\
**A:** No. After the Merge, Portal-wrapped ETH will unwrap for native ETH, which is ETH-PoS.
