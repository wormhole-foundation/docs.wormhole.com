## Demos

As new features get added, we should be able to demonstrate their usage as simply as possible. This gives the dev what they need to start using it right away, without going through an un-skippable cut scene (tutorial).

***ex:***
Instead of writing up a full tutorial, this contract/script shows how to use the opcodes introduced in AVM v7 and was released with a blog post that goes introduces the features with more detail.
