# Wormchain

<!-- TODO: how much should this be detailed? Other relevant links? -->

Wormchain is a purpose-built cosmos blockchain for the Wormhole ecosystem. It has two primary functions:

1. Provide a public and auditable mechanism for users to interact with the Guardian Network.
2. Create a robust platform for on-chain infrastructure which would be infeasible to build elsewhere.

Wormchain is built to provide things like:

    - Redundant security checks
    - Governance
    - Interactions with 'legacy' chains like Bitcoin

Wormchain is less relevant to xDapp developers than some other parts of the ecosystem, but it will become an increasingly important component as Wormhole matures and features are added.
