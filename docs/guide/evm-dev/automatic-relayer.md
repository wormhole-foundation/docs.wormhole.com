A common technical problem with bridges between blockchains is the Relayer Problem. Simply put, this is the problem of who will deliver (or relay) the message from the source chain to the target chain.

Wormhole solves this problem with the Automatic Relayer, which is a feature currently restricted to EVM environments.
