# EVM to Solana

A cornerstone of cross chain apps (xDapps) is the ability to move tokens from one chain to another. Wormhole’s APIs make that a breeze.

Let’s do a simple programmatic transfer from Eth to Solana. First, we need to figure out what address on Solana where we are sending the tokens. Unlike EVM chains where the address is just the wallet address, we need to send the tokens to our recipient address associated token account for that token. We can use a couple helper functions from the Wormhole SDK to make this possible.

```jsx
import {
	Token,
	ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
	TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID
} from '@solana/spl-token';
import {
	getForeignAssetSolana,
	hexToUint8Array,
	nativeToHexString,
	CHAIN_ID_ETH,
} from '@certusone/wormhole-sdk';

const SOLANA_TOKEN_BRIDGE_ADDRESS = "wormDTUJ6AWPNvk59vGQbDvGJmqbDTdgWgAqcLBCgUb";
// determine destination address - an associated token account
const solanaMintKey = new PublicKey(
  (await getForeignAssetSolana(
    connection,
    SOLANA_TOKEN_BRIDGE_ADDRESS,
    CHAIN_ID_ETH,
    hexToUint8Array(nativeToHexString(tokenAddress, CHAIN_ID_ETH) || "")
  )) || ""
);
const recipientAddress = await Token.getAssociatedTokenAddress(
  ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
  TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
  solanaMintKey,
  recipientWalletAddress
);
```

After we have the receipt token account on Solana, we can come back and submit the transfer message on Ethereum. This will output a log that contains a _sequence number_ (A nonce for the message) and an _emitter address_ (the ETH Token Bridge Address as bytes) _._ The sequence number and emitter address will be used to fetch a VAA after it’s been signed by Guardians.

```jsx
import {
	transferFromEth,
	parseSequenceFromLogEth,
	getEmitterAddressEth,
	CHAIN_ID_SOLANA,
} from '@certusone/wormhole-sdk';

const ETH_TOKEN_BRIDGE_ADDRESS = "0x3ee18B2214AFF97000D974cf647E7C347E8fa585";

// Submit transaction - results in a Wormhole message being published
const receipt = await transferFromEth(
  ETH_TOKEN_BRIDGE_ADDRESS,
  signer,
  tokenAddress,
  amount,
  CHAIN_ID_SOLANA,
  recipientAddress
);
// Get the sequence number and emitter address required to fetch the signedVAA of our message
const sequence = parseSequenceFromLogEth(receipt, ETH_BRIDGE_ADDRESS);
const emitterAddress = getEmitterAddressEth(ETH_TOKEN_BRIDGE_ADDRESS);
```

Once the Guardians have signed the token message, we can fetch it to use in the redeem step. If you’re a developer, you might run this as an automatic process through an application specific relayer (more on that in a later thread!)

```jsx
import {
	getSignedVAA,
} from '@certusone/wormhole-sdk';

// Fetch the signedVAA from the Wormhole Network (this may require retries while you wait for confirmation)
const { signedVAA } = await getSignedVAA(
  WORMHOLE_RPC_HOST,
  CHAIN_ID_ETH,
  emitterAddress,
  sequence
);
```

Then we can post the VAA to Solana to mint the tokens. Because of the compute limit on Solana, we split the signature verification and token claim into steps. First we'll verify all the signatures and create a claim account for the Token.Then we can post the VAA to Solana to mint the tokens. Verify the signatures and then puts the VAA on chain and derives the address of the Core Bridge.

```jsx
const SOL_BRIDGE_ADDRESS = "worm2ZoG2kUd4vFXhvjh93UUH596ayRfgQ2MgjNMTth";
// On Solana, we have to post the signedVAA ourselves
await postVaaSolana(
  connection, // Solana Mainnet Connection
  wallet,      //Solana Wallet Signer
  SOL_BRIDGE_ADDRESS,
  payerAddress,
  signedVAA
);
```

Finally, we can claim the tokens.

```jsx
// Finally, redeem on Solana
const transaction = await redeemOnSolana(
  connection,
  SOL_BRIDGE_ADDRESS,
  SOL_TOKEN_BRIDGE_ADDRESS,
  payerAddress,
  signedVAA,
  isSolanaNative,
  mintAddress
);
const signed = await wallet.signTransaction(transaction);
const txid = await connection.sendRawTransaction(signed.serialize());
await connection.confirmTransaction(txid);
```
