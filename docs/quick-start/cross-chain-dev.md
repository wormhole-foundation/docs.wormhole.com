There are two primary ways to enable communication across chains with Wormhole.

1) [Automatic Relaying](#automatic-relaying) - No off chain code required
2) [Specialized Relaying](#specialized-relayer) - Some off chain code may be required

## Automatic Relaying

{% hint style="warning" %}
Automatic Relaying is currently only supported for EVM environments.
{% endhint %}

With Automatic Relaying, only the contracts need to be developed. Leave the message delivery to a service provider. 

[Quick Start](./automatic-relayer.md)


## Specialized Relayer

With Specialized Relaying, the developer can communicate with [any blockchain Wormhole supports](../reference/environments/README.md#blockchains-supported) and has the freedom to choose a delivery strategy.
